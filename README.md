# Shell Project

This is a project to create a Unix shell implementation. It aims to explore the concepts of shell programming and understand the inner workings of a shell.

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)
- [Thompson shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_shell)
- [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson)
- [Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/64)

Man or help:

- `sh` (Run `sh` as well)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
- Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
- Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
- Who is Ken Thompson
- How does a shell work
- What is a pid and a ppid
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of main
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the execve system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is EOF / "end-of-file"?
